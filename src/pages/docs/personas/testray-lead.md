## Description

A *Testray Lead* is a user who typically leads a group of Testray Analysts. They should have permissions to create user groups, create and assign tasks and create other Testray content (Builds, Runs, Results). Some Testray Leads will do some analysis with the team and some may only need to assign and track tasks.

Testray Leads will need permissions necessary for designing a test plan or a task for anlysis. This is why the Testray Lead has permissions on options and product versions. The Testray Lead is restricted from being able to add more high level content like Projects, Case Types and Categories.

Testray Leads will require permissions to create and manage user groups since it's closely tied to task management.
