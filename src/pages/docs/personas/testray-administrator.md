## Description

A *Testray Administrators* has access to all of Testray. These users are normally elevated to be able to administer other users or system configurations.

The Testray Administrator will perform all of the initial configurations, such as configuring and populating a Project and populating options for factors.

In many cases, the administrator wont engage in any of the analysis tasks. This would be left to the [Testray Analyst](/docs/personas/testray-analyst.html), and [Testray Lead](/docs/personas/testray-lead.html).
